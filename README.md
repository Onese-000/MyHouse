# MyHouse

MyHouse is a tenant web application that allows tenants to monitor and keep track of their rental and bill payments. It offers the following functionalities:
  1. An interactive dashboard that uses Google API charts to graphically visualize monthly and annual spendings at a glance. 
  2. A community tab that allows the tenant to link up with other nearby tenants using the MyHouse application. 
  3. A platform where the tenant can opt in and out of bills e.g. WIFI, Swimming, Gym etc. 
  4. A payment module where the tenant can remit his payments through M-PESA
  
  The application is currently in the process of being deployed to Heroku as a Paas.
